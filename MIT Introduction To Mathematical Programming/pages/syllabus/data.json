The topics covered include: formulations, the geometry of linear optimization, duality theory, the simplex method, sensitivity analysis, robust optimization, large scale optimization network flows, solving problems with an exponential number of constraints and the ellipsoid method, interior point methods, semidefinite optimization, solving real world problems problems with computer software, discrete optimization formulations and algorithms.\nCourse Requirements and Grading Grades will be determined by performance on the following requirements. Weights are approximate, and class participation is an important tie breaker.\nACTIVITIES PERCENTAGES Problem sets 30% Midterm exam 30% Final exam 40% Calendar LECÂ # TOPICS 1 Formulations 2-4 Geometry 5-8 Simplex method 9-11 Duality theory 12 Sensitivity analysis 13 Robust optimization Midterm 14-15 Large scale optimization 16-17 Network flows 18 The Ellipsoid method 19 Problems with exponentially many constraints 20-22 Interior point methods 23 Semidefinite optimization 24-25 Discrete optimization Final exam "}

Network flow problems form a subclass of linear programming problems with applications to transportation, logistics, manufacturing, computer science, project management, and finance, as well as a number of other domains. This subject will survey some of the applications of network flows and focus on key special cases of network flow problems including the following: the shortest path problem, the maximum flow problem, the minimum cost flow problem, and the multi-commodity flow problem. We will also consider other extensions of network flow problems.\nThe goals of the subject are the following:\nTo present students with knowledge of the state-of-the-art in the theory and practice of solving network flow problems. To provide students with a rigorous analysis of network flow algorithms. To help each student develop his or her own intuition about algorithm development and algorithm analysis.

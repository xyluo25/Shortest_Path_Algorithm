      <description>Project Description The project provides an opportunity for students to learn about a topic of interest to them as well as to teach other students in the class. Each project team should consist of two or three students. The project consists of a written paper (typically 10 to 15 double spaced pages) as well as an in-class oral presentation of 20 minutes. The project should have some connection to &amp;ldquo;Network Optimization&amp;rdquo; and should be original.</description>
